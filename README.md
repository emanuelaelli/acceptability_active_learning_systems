# acceptability_active_learning_systems
This project was developed within a university internship for the realization of an experimental thesis. The aim of the project was to create a methodology that could be useful for evaluating the most appropriate moments to interrupt the user during the performance of daily activities and to send an Active Learning notification. This evaluation is allowed considering the context in which the user is located. My work focused on the design of a methodology and the subsequent implementation of a prototype that would allow this evaluation through the conduct of experiments. Having only had the period dedicated to the internship, this work has not been completed but will be used by other university students to continue and complete the research.
